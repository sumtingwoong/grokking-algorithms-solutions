# Solutions to problems from chapter 1


## 1.1 A sorted list of 128 names is available. What is the maximum number of checks required for this?
Using the Big-O formula for binary search log₂(n), where n is the number of names in the list, we find the number of iterations log₂(128) = 7


## 1.2 Suppose the list was doubled
log₂(256) = 8


## 1.3 Got a surname, need to find the number in the phone book. P.S.: Need to find Big-O
 Answer: O(log₂(n))


##  1.4 Phone number known, need to find last name in phone book. P.S.: Need to find Big-O
 Answer: O(log₂(n))


 ## 1.5 Need to get the numbers of all the people in the phone book. P.S.: Need to find Big-O
  Answer: O(n)
