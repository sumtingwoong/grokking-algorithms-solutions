# Solutions to problems from chapter 1


## 1.1 A sorted list of 128 names is available. What is the maximum number of checks required for this?
Using the Big-O formula for binary search log₂(n), where n is the number of names in the list, we find the number of iterations log₂(128) = 7


## 1.2 Suppose the list was doubled
log₂(256) = 8
