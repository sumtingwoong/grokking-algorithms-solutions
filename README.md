# Grokking Algorithms – Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes while reading the book **"Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava**.

The goal of this repo is to reinforce understanding of algorithmic thinking, data structures, and problem-solving through simple Python implementations.
